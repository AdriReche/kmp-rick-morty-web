# Rick and Morty API with Kotlin Multiplatform

This is a test project to learn how to use Kotlin Multiplatform by creating a web application that consumes the Rick and
Morty API, following the course
from [Appcademy](https://www.appcademy.dev/kotlin-multiplataforma-compose-curso-definitivo-desde-0).

## Implemented Features

- ✅ Initial project structure
- ✅ Basic navigation system
- ✅ API services and data models for character retrieval
- ✅ Pagination support and UI integration
- ✅ Local Store integration

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin Multiplatform**: Framework for sharing code across platforms
- **Compose Multiplatform**: Declarative UI framework for multiple platforms
- **Kotlin/Wasm**: Compilation to WebAssembly for optimized web performance
- **Rick & Morty API**: External data source for practicing network calls

## Running the Project

To start the web application, run the Gradle task:

```bash
./gradlew :composeApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun
```
